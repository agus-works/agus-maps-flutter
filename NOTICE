OpenStreetMap Data

Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors
Licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL)
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright

The map data used in MWM files is derived from OpenStreetMap and is available
under the Open Database License. For more information, see:
https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/

REQUIRED ATTRIBUTION:
You must display "© OpenStreetMap contributors" wherever map data is shown.
This is typically done as an overlay on the map or in your app's credits.

ODbL allows commercial use but requires:
- Attribution (as above)
- Share-Alike for the DATABASE only (not your app code)
- Keep the data open if you redistribute modified map data

Note: Using MWM files in your app does NOT require you to open-source your app.
The Share-Alike only applies if you modify and redistribute the map data itself.
